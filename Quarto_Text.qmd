## Introduction

Monitoring of 5 sites compared on the Test & Itchen, using the same kick-sample method however, a different count method, with SMART Rivers scheme using full count of all macroinvertebrates in a kick net, whilst the EA uses a quarter then multiplies scores? What's the official term for this?

### Data Obstacles 

Very few surveys at these sites were sampled on the same day due to the distruption of the surveying technique. Therefore, a fuzzy match was used to identify samples at the same sites taken within a <= 1 week. These were then compared. 

The below plot shows whether there are any trends across sites in which samples taken =< 7 days after another impact on score and vice versa. This is to identify whether the act of surveying has a result on the survey.
