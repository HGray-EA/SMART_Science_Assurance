# SMART EA Science Assurance

Compares [Environment Agency]( and [SMART riverfly](https://wildfish.org/project/smart-rivers/) data, with a focus on the rivers [Test & Itchen](https://environment.data.gov.uk/catchment-planning/ManagementCatchment/3097). This project is to provide science assurance between different organisations collecting freshwater macroinvertebrate data using similar techniques at the same sites and on the same days.

Data analysed is for the period 2019 - 2024. In folder X, sites have been selected which are proxies for one-another. 
Open source data from the EA is compared with closed source data from SMART Riverfly. The EA data in question is downloaded [here](https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/3faf10d7-04bc-49e0-8377-61f75186d21d/freshwater-river-macroinvertebrate-surveys-biosys) and SMART Rivers data [here](https://app.cartographer.io/signin?go=%2Fws%2Fwildfish%2Fprojects%2Fsmartrivers%2Fsurveys%2FStSmartRivers), login credentials are required for SMART data.
